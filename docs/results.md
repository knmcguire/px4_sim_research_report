# Final Results

The survey ran for approximately one month (October 14 – November 16, 2025) and received 120 responses. Only 2 participants submitted incomplete forms, representing a 98.3% completion rate.

With an estimated PX4 autopilot user base of 15,000, this sample size yields a margin of error of 9% at a 95% confidence interval. This exceeds the commonly recommended 5% margin of error for surveys, which should be considered when interpreting results and developing recommendations.

## Professions and Domains

The survey revealed that the largest respondent group consisted of "Professional Engineers/Technical Consultants" (54%), followed by "Researchers" (23%) and "Students" (15%) (see @fig-proffdomains). By domain, 44% of respondents worked in commercial aerospace or drone businesses, followed by "Academia and Education" (18%) and "Defense/Government" (16%).
